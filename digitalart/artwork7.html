      <p class="description">
        This was my survival base, it was only my basement room, to get away from all the monsters,
        but I also had created a fort above this that has two levels. Unfortunately I could not take a
        photo of it because I no longer have access to the
        account.
        <br><br>
        I chose to make a camera for this assignment as my cultural significance because I love photography.
        To me photos are my memories, I donâ€™t have a great memory like other people, and looking at photos
        helps me remember. They are my memories and my past. I enjoy looking at photos and what goes on within
        them because they all have their own special messages and different feelings that come with them. I
        also love holding a camera, it makes me feel professional and that I have a purpose. I have been doing
        photography since my 8th-grade yearbook. Photography has become my hope and dream, even though I still
        need to work on taking photos I am trying to get better and hopefully make a career out of it.
