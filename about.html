            <br>
            <p>
              Jozey Nguyen is a Vietnamese-American female artist located in the
              Bay Area. She is aiming for her Bachelor in Fine Arts at San Jose
              State University with a major in Digital Media Arts and a minor in
              Architectural Studies. Studying at this university allowed her to
              experience and learn the diversity of mediums in media and artâ€”her

            <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
              I work in digital art and photography where I bring out different
              perspectives of life. My favorite genre is fantasy because, in a
              world like ours, taking myself away from reality is a deal-breaker
              once in a while. I like to imagine myself in a different world
              where I can breathe with creativity and passion. The audience that
              I want to introduce my artwork to is anyone as I try to bring my
              imagination to life through art. There is a variety of mediums
              that I have used which you can see in my portfolio, I mainly want
              to focus on photography, Photoshop, Illustrator, Blender, and
              video editing. Taking certain things from reality and transforming
              them into something new, different, and compelling will
              reintroduce the audience to a meaningful experience.
