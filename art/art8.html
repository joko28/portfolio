      <p class="description">Art 68: Beginning Sculpture | Multiply It - silicone mold-making & casting
        <br><br>
        The moment I thought of this project was with confusion and frustration, however, as I got help from the professor and classmates, I was able to get an idea of what I wanted to do. During the time of this project, I was going through many emotions in my life along with work and school, so I wanted to incorporate that into my idea. I first saw my image at Target, since it was during the time of Halloween, I bought this little potion bottle that spoke to me. I didn’t know what to use for the mini sculptures, and the professor recommended soap. I thought, why not because soap is a necessity we need during this pandemic to stay clean and healthy.
        <br><br>
        At first, it took me a while to figure out how to make my mold, but after many attempts, I eventually got it. The idea I wanted to illustrate was the thought of how human emotions are a huge influence on our lives. The connection to these psychological states we have to the rice cooker setting is to give the thought of how we put our emotions into our foods. I used the rice cooker pot because it was a simple setting but could have many different meanings since you can do many things with a rice cooker. The different colors give an inviting aesthetic, along with a combination of multiple emotional feelings or thoughts. The mini potion bottles made of soap are multicolored but some also have lavender flower petals at the very top where the cap is which gives it a unique look. I would’ve added rice, however, I didn’t want to waste the food afterward, so the lavender gives it a black rice image. The extra soap bars are just to give it a more aesthetic image side by side with the jar of jam in the middle. I should’ve just put a little bowl of rice in the middle and it would have been much clearer for the viewers to understand. However, I do like the end result of this project because of the idea and how it came out.
        <br><br>
        It’s titled Emotional Mental Seasoning because each bottle has different emotional or mental states labeled on it and each bottle is supposed to be the seasoning of those stated. It was made out of soap because when you cook, you have to clean, and with cleaning, you create a new slate for a different feeling to emerge.
