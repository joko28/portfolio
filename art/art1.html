        <br><br>
        For this collage assignment, I wasn’t too sure about what I wanted to do. I thought about it for a while and just took the time to look for images that were to my taste. Images that I wanted to express, such as what I wanted to do and what I liked. I didn’t know how many photos I would need, so I just printed out as many photos that I took a liking to. When I searched for images, I thought about traveling. Where I wanted to travel were places that people usually want to go to,such as Asia, Paris, Rome, Egypt, and going on a road trip. I thought about the culture in these places, so I wanted to express my culture as well. I am from Vietnam so I wanted to visualize Buddhism and our cultural wear for women.
        <br><br>
        The theme of culture and traveling came to thought as I put this collage together. I love the historical anime genre, therefore I put in some chibi animals, like the Japanese nine tail fox spirit and a human-wolf chibi character. The Chinese culture is very interesting to me as well, so I put in the Chinese zodiac with the dragon and the snake because those are my favorite zodiac animals out of all of them. As I glued my shapes down, I wanted to show some chaos and clear line
        directions in my collage because life is a roller coaster, you don’t know where life will take you. So the directional lines are there to guide the viewer or person to where they want to be. This is how my thought process was as I worked on
        this collage.
